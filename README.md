# twitch-markover

## Running

Run twitch messages through a markov chain

Usage: https://twitch-markover.vercel.app/#cmgriffing,noopcat and so on.

E.g. add a hashtag and a twitch channel. To add more, seperate by comma.

## Training

To train the "bot", simply let it run on some channels. The longer it runs, then "better" it gets!

It uses local-storage to save and load from, so don't be afraid to close the window.
